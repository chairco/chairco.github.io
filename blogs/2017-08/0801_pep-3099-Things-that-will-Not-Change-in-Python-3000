>PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals) 中文稱為 Python 增強建議書，個人比較偏好翻譯成 Python 文件規格書，這一系列的文件主要就是讓 Python 社群在開發過程有個技術規範。[PEP 0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) 是 `PEP` 文件的 index (索引)。[PEP 3000](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3000/) 則定義 `Python 3.0` 的技術規格。耳熟能詳的 [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) 則定義 Python coding style (開發風格)。

>今天想翻譯的這篇 [PEP 3099](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3099/) 是在談論關於很多人給予 `PEP 3000` 規格書上說明建議。作者開宗名義說這些爛建議會讓人很想死，不過還是很好心的列出來一個個討論，覺得挺值得一讀。

## <span id = "abstract">Abstract</span>

Some ideas are just bad. While some thoughts on Python evolution are constructive, some go against the basic tenets of Python so egregiously that it would be like asking someone to run in a circle: it gets you nowhere, even for Python 3000, where extraordinary proposals are allowed. This PEP tries to list all BDFL pronouncements on Python 3000 that refer to changes that will not happen and new features that will not be introduced, sorted by topics, along with a short explanation or a reference to the relevant thread on the python-3000 mailing list.

有些想法可能不好。雖然有些對 Python 的演變來說是有建設性的，但某些則會違反了 Python 的基本原則，就會像是要求某人在圈子裡不斷繞著跑：會讓你無法跳脫，就算是允許非凡提議的 Python 3000 也是如此。這份 PEP 嘗試列出所有在 Python 3000 上 BDEF(Benevolent dictator for life, 仁慈獨裁者) 的聲明會根據主題排序和一份簡短的解釋或引用  python-3000 的信件名單，包含不會發生的更改和不會被引入的新功能。


If you think you should suggest any of the listed ideas it would be better to just step away from the computer, go outside, and enjoy yourself. Being active outdoors by napping in a nice patch of grass is more productive than bringing up a beating-a-dead-horse idea and having people tell you how dead the idea is. Consider yourself warned.

假若你認為有必要提出任何想法，建議你遠離電腦走出房間玩得愉快。在一片漂亮的草地上打盹會遠比提供一個 beating-a-dead-horse 並且讓別人告訴你這麼想法是如此讓人想死來的更好。考慮一下。

## <span id = "corelanguage">Core language</span>

+ Python 3000 will not be case-insensitive.

+ Python 3000 will not be a rewrite from scratch.

>It will also not use C++ or another language different from C as implementation language. Rather, there will be a gradual transmogrification of the codebase. There's an excellent essay by Joel Spolsky explaining why: [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html)


+ self will not become implicit.

>Having self be explicit is a good thing. It makes the code clear by removing ambiguity about how a variable resolves. It also makes the difference between functions and methods small.

>Thread: "Draft proposal: Implicit self in Python 3.0" https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-January/059468.html

>有明確的 `self` 是一件好事。透過消除變量解析的模糊度讓程式碼更乾淨。這樣也會讓不同的函式與類別更精簡。

>線索: "Draft proposal: Implicit self in Python 3.0" https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-January/059468.html


+ lambda will not be renamed.

>At one point lambda was slated for removal in Python 3000. Unfortunately no one was able to come up with a better way of providing anonymous functions. And so lambda is here to stay.

>But it is here to stay as-is. Adding support for statements is a non-starter. It would require allowing multi-line lambda expressions which would mean a multi-line expression could suddenly exist. That would allow for multi-line arguments to function calls, for instance. That is just plain ugly.

>Thread: "genexp syntax / lambda", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/001042.html


>有一點 lambda 曾被定調在 Python 3000 中移除。但不幸的是沒有任何人可以提出一個更好的方法來提供匿名函式，所以 lambda 仍舊被保留了。

> 但


+ Python will not have programmable syntax.

>Thread: "It's a statement! It's a function! It's BOTH!", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/000286.html


+ There won't be a syntax for zip() -style parallel iteration.

>Thread: "Parallel iteration syntax", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-March/000210.html


+ Strings will stay iterable.

>Thread: "Making strings non-iterable", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/000759.html


+ There will be no syntax to sort the result of a generator expression or list comprehension. sorted() covers all use cases.

>Thread: "Adding sorting to generator comprehension", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/001295.html


+ Slices and extended slices won't go away (even if the __getslice__ and __setslice__ APIs may be replaced) nor will they return views for the standard object types.

>Thread: Future of slices https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-May/001563.html


+ It will not be forbidden to reuse a loop variable inside the loop's suite.

> Thread: elimination of scope bleeding of iteration variables https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-May/064761.html


+ The parser won't be more complex than LL(1).

> Simple is better than complex. This idea extends to the parser. Restricting Python's grammar to an LL(1) parser is a blessing, not a curse. It puts us in handcuffs that prevent us from going overboard and ending up with funky grammar rules like some other dynamic languages that will go unnamed, such as Perl.


+ No braces.

>This is so obvious that it doesn't need a reference to a mailing list. Do from __future__ import braces to get a definitive answer on this subject.


+ No more backticks.

>Backticks (`) will no longer be used as shorthand for repr -- but that doesn't mean they are available for other uses. Even ignoring the backwards compatibility confusion, the character itself causes too many problems (in some fonts, on some keyboards, when typesetting a book, etc).

>Thread: "new operators via backquoting", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2007-January/000054.html


+ Referencing the global name foo will not be spelled globals.foo . The global statement will stay.

>Threads: "replace globals() and global statement with global builtin object", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-July/002485.html , "Explicit Lexical Scoping (pre-PEP?)", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-July/067111.html


+ There will be no alternative binding operators such as := .

>Thread: "Explicit Lexical Scoping (pre-PEP?)", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-July/066995.html


+ We won't be removing container literals. That is, {expr: expr, ...}, [expr, ...] and (expr, ...) will stay.

>Thread: "No Container Literals", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-July/002550.html


+ The else clause in while and for loops will not change semantics, or be removed.

>Thread: "have zip() raise exception for sequences of different lengths", https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-August/003338.html


+ hash() won't become an attribute since attributes should be cheap to compute, which isn't necessarily the case for a hash.
