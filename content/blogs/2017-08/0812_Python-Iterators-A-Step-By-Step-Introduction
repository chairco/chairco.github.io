I love how beautiful and clear Python’s syntax is compared to many other programming languages.

和其他語言比較起來，我更喜歡 Python 語法上的美麗以及簡潔。

Let’s take the humble for-in loop, for example. It speaks for Python’s beauty that you can read a Pythonic loop like this as if it was an English sentence:

讓我們來看一下 *for-in* 迴圈的風格，舉例，它代表 Python 的美麗因為你可以看到這一個英文句子，代表 Pythonic 循環。


```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
for n in numbers:
    print(n)
```

**But how do Python’s elegant loop constructs work behind the scenes?** How does the loop fetch individual elements from the object it is looping over? And how can you support the same programming style in your own Python objects?
**但是 Python 這樣優雅的迴圈建構是如何在後端進行運作？**這個迴圈如何從這個物件正在循環的對象中循序的取得個別的元素？同時如何支援同樣的編寫風格在你個人的 Python 物件中？

**You’ll find the answer to these questions in Python’s iterator protocol:**
**你將會得到這些問題的答案在這個 Python 的迭代器協議：**


>Objects that support the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods automatically work with for-in loops.

>物件支援 *__iter__ 與 __next__ dunder* 兩種方法讓 for-in 迴圈能夠自動的運作。


But let’s take things step by step. Just like decorators, iterators and their related techniques can appear quite arcane and complicated on first glance. So we’ll ease into it.

但讓我們一步一步來看看。就像是裝飾器(decorators), 迭代器和他們相關的技術看起來既神秘又複雜。所以我們會慢慢來。

In this tutorial you’ll see how to write several Python classes that support the iterator protocol. They’ll serve as “non-magical” examples and test implementations you can build upon and deepen your understanding with.

在這個教程裡你將會看見如何撰寫幾種 Python 類別來支援迭代的協議。他們將作為幾種"非魔法"例子和實現測試，你可以建立並且深化理解


We’ll focus on the core mechanics of iterators in Python 3 first and leave out any unnecessary complications, so you can see clearly how iterators behave at the fundamental level.

我們將會優先關注 Python 3 中迭代器的核心機制，並且避免更多不必要的併發，所以你可以清楚的看到迭代器在基本層面上的行為。


I’ll tie each example back to the for-in loop question we started out with. And at the end of this tutorial we’ll go over some differences that exist between Python 2 and 3 when it comes to iterators.

我將會把每個例子帶回到我們一開始的 for-in 迴圈問題。在本教程的結尾我們將介紹一些 Python 2 與 Python 3 之間迭代器有關的一些差異。

##Python Iterators That Iterate Forever

##Python 迭代器讓迭代永遠不斷


We’ll begin by writing a class that demonstrates the bare-bones iterator protocol in Python. The example I’m using here might look different from the examples you’ve seen in other iterator tutorials, but bear with me. I think doing it this way gives you a more applicable understanding of how iterators work in Python.

首先我們會撰寫一個類別來演示 Python 裸機下的迭代協議。在這所使用的範例可能會與其他迭代教程有點不同，但請跟著我。我認為這樣做可以讓你更了解 Python 裡迭代器如何運作。


Over the next few paragraphs we’re going to implement a class called Repeater that can be iterated over with a for-in loop, like so:

在接下來的段落中我們將會實現一個稱為 Repeater 的類別，它可以透過 for-in 迴圈來進行迭代。像是這樣：


```python
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
for item in repeater:
    print(item)
```

Like its name suggests, instances of this Repeater class will repeatedly return a single value when iterated over. So the above example code would print the string  Hello to the console forever.

如同名稱所示，類別 Repeater 中的實例會在迭代過程中回傳單一值。所以上述範例碼將會印出字串 Hello 到控制台。


To start with the implementation we’ll define and flesh out the Repeater class first:

接著開始進行實作，首先我們對類別 Repeater 類別做定義和增加


```python
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return RepeaterIterator(self)
```


On first inspection, Repeater looks like a bog-standard Python class. But notice how it also includes the __iter__ dunder method.

在第一段，Repeater 看起來就像是一般的 Python 類別。但是注意到為何這裡也包含了 __iter__ dunder 類別。


What’s the RepeaterIterator object we’re creating and returning from  __iter__? It’s a helper class we also need to define for our for-in iteration example to work:

什麼是 RepeaterIterator 對象我們建立和從 __iter__ 回傳? 它是一個 help 類別我們同時需要對我們 for-in 迭代示意定義進行工作。


```python
class RepeaterIterator:
    def __init__(self, source):
        self.source = source

    def __next__(self):
        return self.source.value
```

Again, RepeaterIterator looks like a straightforward Python class, but you might want to take note of the following two things:



1. In the __init__ method we link each RepeaterIterator instance to the  Repeater object that created it. That way we can hold on to the “source” object that’s being iterated over.

2. In RepeaterIterator.__next__, we reach back into the “source” Repeater instance and return the value associated with it.

In this code example, Repeater and RepeaterIterator are working together to support Python’s iterator protocol. The two dunder methods we defined,  __iter__ and __next__, are the key to making a Python object iterable.

We’ll take a closer look at these two methods and how they work together after some hands-on experimentation with the code we’ve got so far.

Let’s confirm that this two-class setup really made Repeater objects compatible with for-in loop iteration. To do that we’ll first create an instance of Repeater that would return the string 'Hello' indefinitely:

```shell
>>> repeater = Repeater('Hello')
```

And now we’re going to try iterating over this repeater object with a for-in loop. What’s going to happen when you run the following code snippet?

```shell
>>> for item in repeater:
...     print(item)
```

Right on! You’ll see 'Hello' printed to the screen…a lot. Repeater keeps on returning the same string value, and so, this loop will never complete. Our little program is doomed to print 'Hello' to the console forever:

```shell
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
...
```

But congratulations—you just wrote a working iterator in Python and used it with a for-in loop. The loop may not terminate yet…but so far, so good!

Next up we’ll tease this example apart to understand how the __iter__ and  __next__ methods work together to make a Python object iterable.

Pro tip: If you ran the last example inside a Python REPL session or from the terminal and you want to stop it, hit Ctrl + C a few times to break out of the infinite loop.

##How do *for-in* loops work in Python?

At this point we’ve got our Repeater class that apparently supports the iterator protocol, and we just ran a for-in loop to prove it:

```python
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
for item in repeater:
    print(item)
```

Now, what does this for-in loop really do behind the scenes? How does it communicate with the repeater object to fetch new elements from it?

To dispel some of that “magic” we can expand this loop into a slightly longer code snippet that gives the same result:

```python
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
iterator = repeater.__iter__()
while True:
    item = iterator.__next__()
    print(item)
```

As you can see, the for-in was just syntactic sugar for a simple while loop:

+ It first prepared the repeater object for iteration by calling its __iter__ method. This returned the actual iterator object.

+ After that, the loop repeatedly calls the iterator object’s __next__ method to retrieve values from it.

If you’ve ever worked with database cursors, this mental model will seem familiar: We first initialize the cursor and prepare it for reading, and then we can fetch data into local variables as needed from it, one element at a time.

Because there’s never more than one element “in flight”, this approach is highly memory-efficient. Our Repeater class provides an infinite sequence of elements and we can iterate over it just fine. Emulating the same with a Python list would be impossible—there’s no way we could create a list with an infinite number of elements in the first place. This makes iterators a very powerful concept.

On more abstract terms, iterators provide a common interface that allows you to process every element of a container while being completely isolated from the container’s internal structure.

Whether you’re dealing with a list of elements, a dictionary, an infinite sequence like the one provided by our Repeater class, or another sequence type—all of that is just an implementation detail. Every single one of these objects can be traversed in the same way by the power of iterators.

And as you’ve seen, there’s nothing special about for-in loops in Python. If you peek behind the curtain, it all comes down to calling the right dunder methods at the right time.

In fact, you can manually “emulate” how the loop used the iterator protocol in a Python interpreter session:

```shell
>>> repeater = Repeater('Hello')
>>> iterator = iter(repeater)
>>> next(iterator)
'Hello'
>>> next(iterator)
'Hello'
>>> next(iterator)
'Hello'
...
```

This gives the same result: An infinite stream of hellos. Every time you call next() the iterator hands out the same greeting again.

By the way, I took the opportunity here to replace the calls to __iter__ and  __next__ with calls to Python’s built-in functions iter() and next().

Internally these built-ins invoke the same dunder methods, but they make this code a little prettier and easier to read by providing a clean “facade” to the iterator protocol.

Python offers these facades for other functionality as well. For example, len(x) is a shortcut for calling x.__len__. Similarly, calling iter(x) invokes x.__iter__ and calling next(x) invokes x.__next__.

Generally it’s a good idea to use the built-in facade functions rather than directly accessing the dunder methods implementing a protocol. It just makes the code a little easier to read.

##A Simpler Iterator Class

Up until now our iterator example consisted of two separate classes, Repeater and RepeaterIterator. They corresponded directly to the two phases used by Python’s iterator protocol:

First setting up and retrieving the iterator object with an iter() call, and then repeatedly fetching values from it via next().

Many times both of these responsibilities can be shouldered by a single class. Doing this allows you to reduce the amount of code necessary to write a class-based iterator.

I chose not to do this with the first example in this tutorial, because it mixes up the cleanliness of the mental model behind the iterator protocol. But now that you’ve seen how to write a class-based iterator the longer and more complicated way, let’s take a minute to simplify what we’ve got so far.

Remember why we needed the RepeaterIterator class again? We needed it to host the __next__ method for fetching new values from the iterator. But it doesn’t really matter where __next__ is defined. In the iterator protocol, all that matters is that __iter__ returns any object with a __next__ method on it.

So here’s an idea: RepeaterIterator returns the same value over and over, and it doesn’t have to keep track of any internal state. What if we added the __next__ method directly to the Repeater class instead?

That way we could get rid of RepeaterIterator altogether and implement an iterable object with a single Python class. Let’s try it out! Our new and simplified iterator example looks as follows:

```python
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value
```

We just went from two separate classes and 10 lines of code to to just one class and 7 lines of code. Our simplified implementation still supports the iterator protocol just fine:

```shell
>>> repeater = Repeater('Hello')
>>> for item in repeater:
...    print(item)

Hello
Hello
Hello
...
```

Streamlining a class-based iterator like that often makes sense. In fact, most Python iterator tutorials start out that way. But I always felt that explaining iterators with a single class from the get-go hides the underlying principles of the iterator protocol—and thus makes it more difficult to understand.

##Who Wants to Iterate Forever

At this point you’ll have a pretty good understanding of how iterators work in Python. But so far we’ve only implemented iterators that kept on iterating forever.

Clearly, infinite repetition isn’t the main use case for iterators in Python. In fact, when you look back all the way to the beginning of this tutorial, I used the following snippet as a motivating example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
for n in numbers:
    print(n)
```

You’ll rightfully expect this code to print the numbers 1, 2, and 3 and then stop. And you probably don’t expect it to go on spamming your terminal window by printing threes forever until you mash Ctrl+C a few times in a wild panic…

And so, it’s time to find out how to write an iterator that eventually stops generating new values instead of iterating forever. Because that’s what Python objects typically do when we use them in a for-in loop.

We’ll now write another iterator class that we’ll call BoundedRepeater. It’ll be similar to our previous Repeater example, but this time we’ll want it to stop after a predefined number of repetitions.

Let’s think about this for a bit. How do we do this? How does an iterator signal that it’s exhausted and out of elements to iterate over? Maybe you’re thinking, “Hmm, we could just return None from the __next__ method.”

And that’s not a bad idea—but the trouble is, what are we going to do if we want some iterators to be able to return None as an acceptable value?

Let’s see what other Python iterators do to solve this problem. I’m going to construct a simple container, a list with a few elements, and then I’ll iterate over it until it runs out of elements to see what happens:

```shell
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3]
>>> iterator = iter(my_list)

>>> next(iterator)
1
>>> next(iterator)
2
>>> next(iterator)
3
```

Careful now! We’ve consumed all of the three available elements in the list. Watch what happens if I call next on the iterator again:

```shell
>>> next(iterator)
StopIteration
```

Aha! It raises a [StopIteration exception](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration) to signal we’ve exhausted all of the available values in the iterator.

That’s right: Iterators use exceptions to structure control flow. To signal the end of iteration, a Python iterator simply raises the built-in StopIteration exception.

If I keep requesting more values from the iterator it’ll keep raising StopIteration exceptions to signal that there are no more values available to iterate over:

```shell
>>> next(iterator)
StopIteration
>>> next(iterator)
StopIteration
...
```

Python iterators normally can’t be “reset”—once they’re exhausted they’re supposed to raise StopIteration every time next() is called on them. To iterate anew you’ll need to request a fresh iterator object with the iter() function.

Now we know everything we need to write our BoundedRepeater class that stops iterating after a set number of repetitions:

```python
class BoundedRepeater:
    def __init__(self, value, max_repeats):
        self.value = value
        self.max_repeats = max_repeats
        self.count = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.count >= self.max_repeats:
            raise StopIteration
        self.count += 1
        return self.value
```

This gives us the desired result. Iteration stops after the number of repetitions defined in the max_repeats parameter:

```shell
>>> repeater = BoundedRepeater('Hello', 3)
>>> for item in repeater:
        print(item)
Hello
Hello
Hello
```

If we rewrite this last for-in loop example to take away some of the syntactic sugar, we end up with the following expanded code snippet:

```python
repeater = BoundedRepeater('Hello', 3)
iterator = iter(repeater)
while True:
    try:
        item = next(iterator)
    except StopIteration:
        break
    print(item)
```

Every time next() is called in this loop we check for a StopIteration exception and break the while loop if necessary.

Being able to write a three-line for-in loop instead of an eight lines long while loop is quite a nice improvement. It makes the code easier to read and more maintainable. And this is another reason why iterators in Python are such a powerful tool.

##Python 2.x Compatible Iterators

All the code examples I showed here were written in Python 3. There’s a small but important difference between Python 2 and 3 when it comes to implementing class-based iterators:

+ In Python 3, the method that retrieves the next value from an iterator is called __next__.

+ In Python 2, the same method is called next (no underscores).

This naming difference can lead to some trouble if you’re trying to write class-based iterators that should work on both versions of Python. Luckily there’s a simple approach you can take to work around this difference.

Here’s an updated version of the InfiniteRepeater class that will work on both Python 2 and Python 3:

```python
class InfiniteRepeater(object):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value

    # Python 2 compatibility:
    def next(self):
        return self.__next__()
```

To make this iterator class compatible with Python 2 I’ve made two small changes to it:

First, I added a next method that simply calls the original __next__ and forwards its return value. This essentially creates an alias for the existing __next__ implementation so that Python 2 finds it. That way we can support both versions of Python while still keeping all of the actual implementation details in one place.

And second, I modified the class definition to inherit from object in order to ensure we’re creating a new-style class on Python 2. This has nothing to do with iterators specifically, but it’s a good practice nonetheless.

##Python Iterators – A Quick Summary

+ Iterators provide a sequence interface to Python objects that’s memory efficient and considered Pythonic. Behold the beauty of the for-in loop!

+ To support iteration an object needs to implement the iterator protocol by providing the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods.

+ Class-based iterators are only one way to write iterable objects in Python. Also consider generators and generator expressions.
